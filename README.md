# CATAMI Classification Scheme

The **CATAMI Classification Scheme** is designed to facilitate the aggregation, annotation, and automated processing of underwater imagery across Australia. This classification is essential for consistent marine ecology research, providing standardized annotations of marine life across various ecosystems.

For further information and to cite the classification, please refer to the following journal article:

## Getting Started with the CATAMI Classification

The documentation below will help you understand and integrate the CATAMI Classification Scheme into your work.

### 1. **Visual Guide**

The Visual Guide contains all CATAMI codes along with visual examples selected by expert marine ecologists from across Australia. This guide is invaluable for identifying species and understanding the classification system.

### 2. **CATAMI Code File**

The CATAMI CAAB codes are available in a spreadsheet (CSV format). This file allows you to develop your own conversion tables and is a useful resource for working with the CATAMI classification in your own systems.

### 3. **CATAMI Technical Document**

The Technical Document provides an in-depth explanation of the CATAMI Classification Scheme. It includes detailed information about the creation, organization, and usage of the classification system.
